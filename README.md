# Coding Notes

## Basic Plot using matplotlib

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.ylabel('some numbers in y')
plt.xlabel('some numbers in x')
plt.show()
```

## Basic Histogram Plot

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [21, 23, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 17, 18]
num_bins = 5
plt.hist(x, num_bins, facecolor='red')
plt.show()
```

## No Free Lunch Theorem

There is no single algorithm that will work well for all tasks.

## Machine Learning Types

- **Supervised:** Involves labeled data, e.g., regression.
- **Unsupervised:** Involves unlabeled data, e.g., clustering and anomaly detection.
- **Reinforcement:** Involves rewarding desired behaviors and punishing undesired ones.

## Data Mining

It refers to the extraction of useful information from raw data. Another term for it is KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Data).

## Digital Ads and CTR

Digital ads are expected to have a higher CTR (Click-Through Rate) compared to traditional advertisements.
