# Data-Science-Bootcamp
Where Data Science learning becomes easy

Basic Plot using matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
plt.plot([1,2,3,4])
plt.ylabel('some numbers in y')
plt.xlabel('some numbers in x')
plt.show()

Basic histogram plot

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x=[21,23,4,5,6,7,8,3,4,17,18]
num_bins = 5
plt.hist(x,num_bins,facecolor='red')
plt.show()

No Free Lunch theorem - There are no single algorithm that will work well for all task

Machine Learning type supervised,unsupervised,semi-supervised,reinforcement learning

Supervised like regression
Unsupervised like clustering and anomaly
Reinforcement like rewarding desired behaviors and punishing undesired ones

Data mining: extract useful information from raw data (another name is KDD : Knowledge Discovery in Data)
Digital ads will have higher CTR : Call_Through Rate that traditional advertisment
